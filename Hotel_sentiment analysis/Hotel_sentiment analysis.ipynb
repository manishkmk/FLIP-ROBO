The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.\",\n",

I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.',\n",

We came down, the bell man asked if we needed a cab, we told him we were waiting for our car. we waited -- minutes, with him standing right there at the bell stand, then he disappeared. we went inside to ask and the receptionist told us she forget to tell him to get it, and he was busy, so we would have to wait. She apologized, we waited another -- minutes, the manager asked if we were being helped, we explained our situation at which point the bell man came up and said he was busy and very rudely told us he would go get and was mumbling about us as he left-very bad customer service-given it was their mistake.

We heard conversations from our neighbors and then the odor of whatever weed they were smoking next door started to fill our room.

       " 'i would recommend anyone thinking of staying in this hotel to reconsider immediately and stay at the nearby hudson hotel instead although we had booked superior room the room was tiny and most of the furniture fittings and wall coverings had seen better days on the website the rooms looked spacious light and airy in reality they were small gloomy and grubby we had to lift our suitcases over the bed of the shaped room as there was not room to wheel them past after looking at the room we called the front desk to ask if alternatives were available after attempted calls when the phone went unanswered we finally got through and expressed our disappointment we were offered larger room on higher floor although we were warned that it did not have view the current view from the room we were currently in was of the back of building and car park so we decided to take the risk the next room we were given had more room only in that the bed was barely bigger than single the desk and chair had been removed and the tv was half the size of the previous room there was not even room anywhere for the coffee machine which had been situated in the bathroom there was no wardrobe but there was small single sized built in cupboard housing electrical and telephone switchgear with small rail although we had booked room with free wifi it did not reach this room and without desk would have been unable to do any work or use my laptop attempted to contact the front desk once more and after another calls which were unanswered again got through to the front desk explained that this room was in no way superior and was in fact smaller and less well equipped than the previous room was told that no other rooms were available but that if we wanted to move back to the first room we were offered could do so however was advised that for an additional we could upgrade to suite the following day when bookings were wide open by this time we were now running late for dinner appointment so we agreed to stay in the current room on condition we could move to suite the following day we were told that if we packed our suitcases in the morning when we left the hotel staff would move them to suite the following afternoon and we could collect keys when we returned in the evening the following morning on leaving the hotel for the day we handed back our keys asked for confirmation of the move to suite we were told in very offhand manner that there was no possibility of such move as the hotel was fully booked the desk clerk disputed that we could have been told the above information about room change we then asked to speak to the duty manager who was quite frankly very rude and was completely unconcerned that our weekend was being ruined by this time staff had lied to me twice about the move to the bigger room the previous day and about suite being available today noticed the manager was smirking at my annoyance and suggested that this was inappropriate and she laughed in my face this suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction as frequent business and leisure traveler have never before experienced such terrible product or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction the attitude of the female duty manager on the morning of saturday june was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and cannot understand how on earth she was ever given position of responsibility luckily we moved to the hudson hotel which for similar room rate was in totally different league and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful when we advised the manger that we were checking out early she had the audacity to ask what was wrong and indicated we would be charged for an additional night even though we had spent less that hrs in the hotel and were checking out at am it was only after further discussion when indicated would dispute the charge on my credit card that this was dropped the front desk staff and duty manager on friday june and particularly sat june are quite possibly the worst have ever encountered would suggest that as any prospective customers of on the ave hotel choose the hudson rather than this dowdy and shabby establishment populated by rude and unpleasant staff ',\n",

result all of them and mean all of them closed at or pm because it was week night even the pizza place closed early in short there are only places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after pm mc s or burgerk so after hours of driving we had to get back in the car and head out for paper sack full of drive thru deep fried greasy grub and couple of cokes as for the room the room itself was small but not as small as some of the hotel rooms ve stayed in our room was probably around the kitchenette is open to the room and there is small table separating the spaces there is not enough room for sofa but there was recliner parked in the corner there was nothing in the room that wasn functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty the ac appeared to be newer and worked fine the room was very clean but appeared somewhat dated we did not use the appliances except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker both of which worked fine the coffee was awful however bring your own if you can the bathroom was very clean and it had full size tub with shower the water pressure was good and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing oddly there was no shampoo in the shower and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the mcd drive thru the bed was very firm had no problem but the wife didn sleep well because it was too firm for her the pillows were the typical synthetic non allergic spun polyester type which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee but if you use just one pillow your head will sink to the mattress which suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers the next morning we looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room with the exception of the repeated high pitched angry screaming and squeals of someone precious little darling outside our door no want the something or other as we packed up to check out we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway so noise was generally not problem checkout was easy and took all of twenty seconds we were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there we probably will not stay there again because we honestly don really have reason to return to the area think for business professional who doesn have an expense account and isn reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however it would be good inexpensive option as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before pm you double check your reservation bring your own pillow coffee and shampoo and you don expect the four seasons or the fairmont for ',\n",

       " 'my family girls ages and my husband stayed here for week from august to the in one room with queen beds for those of you who want quick summary it here at the top the details are all below summary cons beds were small ac was noisy rooms smell of vapor rub avoid the pool and hot tub sunday evening through wednesday night it a health hazard outdoor area has mosquitos bring bug spray for evenings outdoors in the restaurant or at the pool area family budget restaurant is typical san diego prices which are expensive for family eat elsewhere if possible if you re on budget or utilize the restaurants happy hour for good deal the food we did have was good tho you cannot safely walk to the beach from this hotel even tho it advertised as such pros rooms were clean comfortable and well appointed hotel was in business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach pool area was fun and well designed but only use when the pool has been cleaned well located for access to san diego seaworld and legoland the only reason we stayed here is because we got off deal on the room and it was close to the beach and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids which turned out to be not the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there would not stay here again at the same per night with or full price details the rooms are decent sized beds are comfortable it was clean the queen beds are actually doubles or very close to it much smaller queens than in any other hotel we ve stayed at the kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night the room a unit was very loud not just the normal fan sound but loud buzzing background noise as well if you are light sleeper that needs to be cool would suggest avoiding this hotel the rooms smell like vapor rub other reviewers said that the rooms smelled and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up it wasn over powering to us but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first minutes or so food and amenities the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access day we didn use it because both our smart phones have eating out in san diego is expensive and the hotels restaurant is no exception we avoided the breakfast buffet at per adult kid and instead walked block to the nearby green leaf cafe business cafe and got decent breakfast for the whole family for we also found that the hotels happy happy hour between pm was great and during that time would split few appetizers each vs per entree during regular hours for dinner with the kids however most nights we didn make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over the pool if you have kids who love to swim and are coming to this hotel to use the pool be warned there are some caveats to save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on thursday and friday we arrived on monday night and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool and in about minutes we were disgusted rating there were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool maxipad diaper or tissue m not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out in addition to the gross stuff on the bottom the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs bugs normal pool debris etc the pool pump and filters were not running there was large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot tub in addition there were mosquitos outside and ended up getting bitten several times that evening even tho we were outdoors for about min all of us who swam that night me and the two kids had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day we avoided the pool for the next few days mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach sea world and legoland but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of broken pump and it would be better the next time friday morning we had chance to check out the pool again and it looked to our amazement much better would say b rating friday night they had movie showing in the pool area which was lot of fun and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it other reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate laundry there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in very disapointing as we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us while the other took care of the laundry the hotel does have laundry service but given the prices of everything else there suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do family of fours days worth of laundry so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie and spend friday night at the landromat at del mar heights and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed shuttle the hotel provides free shuttle to anywhere within miles of the hotel which includes del mar beach this was the best beach we found for quality bathrooms and changing area were amazing here and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves when called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions the operator was fairly curt and impatient but the shuttle service was nice the picked us up at cafe we found near the beach speaking of the beach the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel we asked at the front desk while we were there and they said there was no safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids this seems like false advertising to me yelp if you have smart phone and car yelp came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat the gps google maps were also invaluable ',\n",

the hotel over the pool had found special for night through travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel the room was not large but was comfortable enough the rack rate on the door was small fridge was in the tv cabinet with drawers was convenient beds were great the bathroom was compact but there was short shelf under the sink to use and shelf over the toilet tub had short shelf on the back and had curved shower rail so it was fine nice showerhead tv reception would be great and then go snowy at times the small walk in closet did not have light so made good use of the flashlight packed good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse glass knobs on bath and closet door and full size mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open had to ask the housekeeper for robes and foam pillow the second morning of our stay and she had this for us when we returned to our room later being select guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning and we opted for bagel or english muffin each that kept us going until lunch later in the day few times napkins silverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old tough and rock hard only complaint we really had one day we ordered some snacks in the evening and room service brought them to us on table in the room so we felt special we had few desserts from morsels we had bought downstairs internet signal was weak and an ethernet bridge was provided ended up using my data card have which was faster we ate at robert in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good staff and service was excellent from the bellmen check in front desk concierge maid room service and engineers staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted the hotel lobby is grand the roses changed several times during the week and the lobby floor shines immaculately definitely impressive our room was very clean the bath rug was removed and missing few days so we asked for another one we spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp we were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel and believed it was four diamond quality it cost us plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from national airport you have to get in line to obtain cab which can be confusing and plus tip back from the omni through abe sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and with luggage we were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior trip advisor reviews so that was no surprise we experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on everything was still handled quickly which impressed us despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways we loved the hotel and if returning to washington dc area would definitely stay here again at the omni shoreham we heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison the metro is close by and convenient to the omni we purchased smart trip cards each at metro central about three stops from woodley park so it costs to get there and put on for my card and for my husband card he is senior so his fare rates were half price we still had some money left on the cards after two weeks you can go to the website metroopensdoors com to get directions from woodley park to wherever you want to go which is convenient the smart trip cards also get you on some local area buses including the dc circulator that we used to get to georgetown we did the grayline double decker hop on and hop off tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel you have two days to use your ticket and we loved this bus tour excellent and highly recommend it we liked it so much we did six hour tour on another day with grayline to go see mt vernon go to union station before am to buy your ticket and board our first tour vendor we had tried on our second night was through royal trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight it was big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in van another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was okay but not great like they had experienced before would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night and consider one with guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in washington dc places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood we tried the lebanese taverna on connecticut one night but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good neither my husband or would recommend going there and it was around person we tried the café paridiso on connecticut ave the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on tripadvisor but were disappointed and would not return favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel open city café across on calvert street petits plats around the block on connecticut ave is excellent we ate there our last night order the floating island for dessert petits plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out we ordered chinese take out once lunch specials and soup from the eddie cafe across on calvert but address says connecticut ave and were favorably impressed and recommend chipolte is on calvert across the street too good mexican food and guacamole chips for reasonable price we ate there several times we had mcdonald a time or two that is on connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel the cvs pharmacy on connecticut has cookies chips sodas and water and is convenient about block or so away from the hotel we bought items and sundries quite few times at cvs which is conveniently located dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby however there is place in dupont circle that says they have the best cupcakes in window when you walk by and you go downstairs we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting if you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes be sure to stop it is not far from the grayline hop on hop off double decker tour bus stop in dupont circle our favorite place to eat in washington dc that we highly recommend worth the trip is the old ebbitt grill historic landmark since at th st near the white house in washington we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once excellent food good prices and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area we also ate at fago de chao at pennsylvania ave near the old post office tower it is brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food treat but will run you person plus tax and tip we ate once at mccormick schmidt on street in washington which was very good we ate lunch once at ella wood fired pizza which was good the chart house in alexandria was enjoyable with great food we also liked the buffet at the garden café in the national gallery of art at th and constitution w which filled us up for the afternoon activities one of the best maps we used was washington the nation capital that you can obtain from the park service at the white house visitor center we took several with us had some others but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around and we went back to get more the international spy museum is great and worth the price to visit be sure to see the fd roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin between the jefferson and lincoln memorials if you want some good bargains ladies will enjoy filene basement to shop we explored alexandria and georgetown check out the canals there in georgetown as well as washington dc we even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the orangutans go across the line which was amazing check with your representative few months ahead of time to book white house tour the library of congress amazing and the bureau of engraving the omni shoreham is quality hotel to experience and an excellent base to explore washington dc and the surrounding area wonderful and memorable trip for us the fall leaves made it even more spectacular ',\n",

       " 'we were visiting boston for one night attending red sox game prior to spending our vacation on cape cod prior to booking our stay we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at garage next store we booked our stay at the buckmister as we thought garage would be more secure than surface lot our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility the parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time not that the lot is secured in fact no gates are closed security cameras are facing backwards it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars the hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage fair enough but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby when they know the parking is not secure overnight they are hotel they know the cars are going to be there overnight would not recommend anyone stay at the buckmister if they are traveling with car ',\n",
       " 'we stayed for one week at the affinia dumont hotel in nyc and were very happy the room we had had decent size was always kept very clean by the room maid and you could not beat the location it is about eight minutes walking distance to the empire state building and once you are there you are in the heart of manhattan and it up to your fantasy what you will do with the rest of your time the possibilities are endless we did not try breakfast at the hotel nor any of the other amenities checking in was fast efficient and friendly service one of the bell boys was very nice and helpful while another one should take some lessons from the first guy regarding service and friendliness towards the customer also walking to penn station is quite doable walked there twice it super easy down the street few blocks and make one turn and voila takes about minutes walking time all in all we liked it so much we are returning in the fall two more times and will stay there again ',\n",
       " 'i stayed at lowell during business trip the hotel is perfectly located in an elegant residential area right east of central park south you just need block to reach the underground when in nyc avoid midtown too bustling the hotel itself is very elegant boutique size intimate the staff is extremely welcoming professional yet friendly had deluxe room and it was perfect size will be back ',\n",
       " 'this hotel was reasonably priced and in good location the room was clean and bed was comfortable the breakfast buffet was quite good my only big complaint was the service have never seen such terrible service in any hotel am not weekly traveler but do travel times per year was left on hold at the front desk for over minutes not once but twice this was just to ask question getting the car took over minutes absolutely the worst of all of them were the bartenders and wait staff at the hotel restaurant bar it was like we were invisible there were plenty of people working but they were just standing around trying not to make eye contact it was really hard to believe how bad the service was should mention that stayed at this hotel year ago and didn have these complaints about service don know what has changed but won stay there again ',\n",
       " 'i just returned from three night stay in the belvedere from the moment arrived felt like the staff was conscious of all my needs the check in was easy arrived early and my room was not ready but the staff checked me in took my bag and assured me my room would be ready no later than m when arrived back everything was in order the room was spacious and clean it looked like it had been recently remodeled the room was quiet was on the th floor and there was no street noise my only complaint would be the slow elevators this was the only inconvenience during my stay the location is outstanding went to three musicals during my stay and was within minutes walking time of all the theaters the staff was friendly and offered suggestions even after check out they helped me in every way possible to get my cab for the airport in general would give this hotel an i will definitely stay there on my next visit to new york city ',\n",
       " 'simply it a great hotel the staff was incredible the views from corner room were great but be ready to pay for this an adequate price including for overnight parking and continental breakfast for two ',\n",
       " 'i stay at the figueroa whenever am in la it is truly charming and each room has sense of character unlike the sterile tedium of your average regular hotel the bar is always full of interesting people the staff if friendly and helpful and with fellow guests from all over the world flocking to the figueroa one is always filled with sense of la as world destination ',\n",
       " 'we enjoyed the hotel very much it is great place to stay for the money rooms were very clean and newly remodeled we were very surprised to have fridge and also microwave in the rooms concidering what we were paying the best thing for me were the wonderful pillows have hard time sleeping at home slept like baby with those pillows we even asked if we could purchase some pillows before checking out the manager was so nice he checked with housekeeping to see which kind we had in our room we were able to purchase new pillows wish had purchased but will be back some time again now sleep good at home and tell friends about these great pillows they will stay in the same hotel when ever they are traveling to san diego ',\n",
